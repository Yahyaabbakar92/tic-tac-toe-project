## Things I learned

## Thought process

- Firstly I need to create a module pattern to hold my board array and returns the array as an object.
- Create a player factory that holds player marker and returns the marker.
- Create the module for displayController that handles the rendering of content on the webpage
- Create the module for Game that controls the flow of logic

## Need to Refactor

## Things I need to review

- Advanced CSS selectors such as :nth-child()
- Understand Grid
